# üõ∞Ô∏è SkyCaptions - Satellite Image Captioning using BiLSTMs and ViT Feature Extractor

SkyCaptions generates captions for satellite images using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks and the Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractor. This combination allows for effective extraction of image features and sequential modeling of captions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the SkyCaptions project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (depending on your implementation preference).

## Features
* ViT Feature Extraction: Extracts high-level features from satellite images using the Vision Transformer (ViT).
* BiLSTM Captioning: Generates captions for satellite images using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks.
* Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance on test datasets.
* Data Visualization: Visualizes the results with the generated captions overlayed on the images.

## Dataset
This project uses the satellite image caption generation dataset from Kaggle.
You can find and download the dataset from the following link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomtillo/satellite-image-caption-generation)
